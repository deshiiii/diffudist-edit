Description: Computing the diffusion distance for complex single-layer networks.
    Given a network one can obtain different types of Laplacian (or transition)
    matrices corresponding to different continuous-time random walks dynamics, i.e., 
    continuous-time Markov chians on the vertex set. This package enables the evaluation of 
    Laplacians, stochastic matrices, and the corresponding diffusion distance matrices.
