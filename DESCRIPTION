Description: Enables the evaluation of diffusion distances for complex single-layer networks.
    Given a network one can obtain different types of Laplacian (or transition)
    matrices corresponding to different continuous-time random walks dynamics on the network. 
    This package enables the evaluation of Laplacians, stochastic matrices, and the 
    corresponding diffusion distance matrices. The metric structure induced by the network-driven
    process is richer and more robust than the one given by shortest-paths and allows to study 
    the geometry induced by different types of diffusion-like communication mechanisms taking 
    place on complex networks.
